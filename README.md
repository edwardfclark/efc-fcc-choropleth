# efc-fcc-choropleth

User Experience:

1) My choropleth has a title with a corresponding id="title".
2) My choropleth has a description element with a correspondig id="description".
3) My choropleth should have counties with a corresponding class="county" that represent the data.
4) There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the counties.
5) My counties should have data-fips and data-education properties containing their corresponding fips and education values.
6) My choropleth should have a county for each provided data point.
7) The counties should have data-fips and data-education values that match the sample data.
8) My choropleth should have a legend with a correspondig id="legend".
9) There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the legend.
10) I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip", which displays more information about the area.
11) My tooltip should have a data-education property that corresponds to the data-education of the active area.

Here are the datasets I'm going to need to use to complete the project. There are two this time.
